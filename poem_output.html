            <h1>Generated Poem (Sad Mood)</h1>
            <pre>Night's swirling sorrow, a canvas unbound,
Stars like teardrops, scattered and drowned.
Cypress, a spire of lonely despair,
Whispers the wind, a grief beyond compare.

Below, a village sleeps, unaware,
Of heavens weeping, a burden to bear.
Pale moon hangs heavy, a sorrowful gleam,
Lost in the eddy of a tormented dream.
